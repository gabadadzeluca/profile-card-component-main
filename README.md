## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned that it's neccessary to use Mobile-first aproach. Used flex in css multiple times, and added background-image with url.


### Continued development

Adding image that's not connected to a column or a row was a challange. I used position:absolute for the solution, but there must be better ways to style the image.
